# Intro
Intro to JavaScript.

# Strings
## Single or Double quotes?
It doesn't matter... as long as you use single quotes.

## slice, substr, and substring
+ `slice` Use it if you know the start and the end.
+ `substr` Use it if you know the start and the length.
+ `substring` Don't use it because it's just a dumb version of `slice`.

# Loops
## Statements
+ `for` Use it when you know the start and end of a loop.
+ `do...while`
+ `while` Use it when you don't know the start and end of a loop.
+ `label`
+ `break`
+ `continue`
+ `for...in`
+ `for...of`
+ `for each...in` Don't use it because it's obsolete. Use `for...of` instead.

## Arrays
+ `forEach`

# Functions

# "Falsey" values
+ Don't use 'undefined' in your code.
