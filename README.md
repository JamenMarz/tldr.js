# Intro
Intro to JavaScript.

# Strings
## Single or Double quotes?
It doesn't matter... as long as you use single quotes.

## slice, substr, and substring
+ `slice` Use it if you know the start and the end.
+ `substr` Use it if you know the start and the length.
+ `substring` Don't use it because it's just a dumb version of `slice`.

# Loop
## for and while
+ `for` Use it when you know the start and end of a loop.
+ `while` Use it when you dont' know the start and end of a loop.

# Functions
